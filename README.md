to XenHat: 
   When compiling each of these programs, there are three files that are always missing, and I cannot find them. I'm trying to follow the inclosed instructions. They have 3 character extensions that I've never seen before. I'd like to bring up the programs and see what they are and what they do. Can you please help me.   Thanks,   skiutah1        Jan 29, 2019
